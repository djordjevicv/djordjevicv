# Vojin Đorđević

I am a computer science student at Faculty of Sciences and Mathematics, at University of Niš. Altough I am familiar with a vast amount of software development technologies, I specialize in Front-End development, building real-life projects using HTML, CSS, Javascript, Bootstrap, React, Git and NodeJS.
